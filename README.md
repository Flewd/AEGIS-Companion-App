AEGIS-Companion-App
===================

Android app to assist players in streamlining the tabletop game AEGIS.

AEGIS Companion App

In an ideal world, the AEGIS Companion app will help players in and outside of game-play in regards to strategizing and learning about robots. It will also help us as developers continue to create a better game by having a tool to quickly reference take note of playtest cards.

Once this is “complete”, we would have one for release on the app store and one for us with its own database of experimental design stuff. The avg damage calculator probably won’t be in the users’ release version either.

Features:

Dice Calculator: This should let a person punch in Dice #, Accuracy, Power, along with checkboxes for All Above and CRT, CRT and CRT so we can more accurately see how much the damage fluctuates when we put CRT (or multiple instances thereof) on things.

Card Viewer: This should be a little card encyclopedia. It would pull from on online Excel sheet and spit out a semi-accurate looking card. This would be useful for testing new robots.
- For robots that are already printed, the current pngs could most likely be used, and the database would just pull its stats for sorting purposes? It would be nice to sort robots alphabetically, by Class and by Level. 

Team Builder: Here, the players should be able to look through the list of robots and select a bunch of them to add to a team. There should be some sort of toggle for each robot: whether you want it to be one of your main 5 or whether you want it to be one of your 2 sideboard robots. So a total of seven Basic robots can be chosen at any time. Any combined robots chosen go to that teams’ combine pool.

Team Viewer: You look at saved teams on this list. When you select a team, you see them as a list.
-If you select a card from the list, the image comes up and it would be awesome to be able to swipe back and forth across them. 
-The initial list should also be sort them going Your 5 bot Team -> Your 2 Sideboard Guys -> Your combined robots
-You should also be able to edit your team.

--New And Exciting--

Ability Index: It would be great to have a searchable index all abilities and attributes.

Rulebook imbed/link: It would also be great to have a link to the rulebook pdf on here. It’d be great if it were embedded but we’d need a text version of it first.
